This is a bot for the Swords and Souls. It will not be finished.
This was a quick project intended to get some practice with the concepts, I got the idea and it no longer interests me.

At the moment, there are just some methods for the training.
The actual goal here isn't to make a bot, just to get some experience in with the libraries.

Training:
1. Attack - This one is super-human. The only thing that kills it is a lag spike.
2. Block - This one works, but it is far from perfect. It ignores stars.
I haven't even looked at the other training options.
