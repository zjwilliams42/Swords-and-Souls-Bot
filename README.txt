This is a bot for the Swords and Souls. It may eventually be finished, but it likely wont be.

At the moment, there are just some methods for the training.
The actual goal here isn't to make a bot, just to get some experience in with the libraries.

Training:
1. Attack - This on is super-human. The only thing that kills it is a lag spike.
2. Block - This one works, but it is far from perfect. It ignores stars.
I haven't even looked at the other training options.
